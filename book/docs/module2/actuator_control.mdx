## Learning Objectives

- Understand fundamental actuator control techniques.
- Learn about feedback mechanisms for precise motion.

## Overview

This chapter focuses on how individual actuators are controlled and how feedback from sensors is used to achieve precise and robust robotic movements.

## Main Content

Precise and robust control of actuators is paramount for humanoid robots to execute desired movements, interact with objects, and maintain balance. This involves sophisticated control algorithms and effective utilization of sensor feedback.

### Types of Actuator Control

Actuators in humanoid robots can be controlled in various modes, each suited for different tasks:

1.  **Position Control**: The most common mode, where the controller attempts to drive the actuator to a specific joint angle or position. It's simple to implement but can be stiff and less suitable for physical interaction.
    *   **Application**: Reaching a target pose, holding a fixed posture.

2.  **Velocity Control**: The controller aims to achieve a desired joint velocity. Often used for continuous movements or when precise speed is required.
    *   **Application**: Smooth walking gaits, continuous motion paths.

3.  **Torque Control**: The controller directly commands the force or torque generated by the actuator. This is more complex but offers greater control over physical interaction, enabling compliant behaviors and accurate force exertion.
    *   **Application**: Dexterous manipulation, safe human-robot interaction, walking on uneven terrain.

### Feedback Control Mechanisms

Feedback from sensors is crucial for ensuring that the actual movement of the robot matches the desired movement and for reacting to external disturbances.

1.  **PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) Control**: A widely used feedback loop mechanism. It calculates an "error" value as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms of this error.
    *   **Proportional (P)**: Responds to the current error.
    *   **Integral (I)**: Addresses accumulated past errors (reduces steady-state error).
    *   **Derivative (D)**: Responds to the rate of change of the error (predicts future error, dampens oscillations).
    *   **Application**: Joint position control, velocity control.

2.  **Admittance/Impedance Control**: These advanced control strategies are used when robots need to physically interact with the environment or humans. They relate the force applied to the robot's end-effector to its motion (admittance) or the motion of the end-effector to the forces it exerts (impedance).
    *   **Admittance Control**: Makes the robot 'yield' to external forces, behaving like a spring-damper system. Useful for safe interaction.
    *   **Impedance Control**: Makes the robot exert forces in response to its environment, behaving as if it has a desired stiffness and damping.

3.  **Whole-Body Control (WBC)**: For humanoid robots, controlling individual joints in isolation is insufficient. WBC coordinates the movements of all joints simultaneously to achieve a desired task (e.g., maintain balance, reach an object) while respecting physical constraints (e.g., joint limits, contact forces).
    *   **Application**: Dynamic walking, pushing heavy objects while maintaining balance, multi-contact manipulation.

### Importance of Compliance

Compliance, the ability to deform or yield in response to applied forces, is vital for humanoid robots. It can be achieved through:

*   **Passive Compliance**: Inherently built into the mechanical design (e.g., Series Elastic Actuators).
*   **Active Compliance**: Achieved through control algorithms (e.g., torque control, admittance control).
    *   **Benefits**: Enhanced safety (reduces impact forces), improved robustness to uncertainties, better adaptation to uneven surfaces, more natural human-robot interaction.

## Summary

Actuator control and feedback are essential for humanoid robots to achieve precise and robust movements. Control modes include position, velocity, and torque control, each offering different advantages for various tasks. Feedback mechanisms, particularly PID control, are crucial for correcting errors and achieving desired performance. Advanced strategies like admittance/impedance control enable safe and effective physical interaction, while Whole-Body Control coordinates complex, multi-joint movements. Compliance, whether passive or active, is a key property for improving robot safety, robustness, and natural interaction with the physical world.
